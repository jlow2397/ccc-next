        Helen Low has worked in the accounting/finance sector for 30+ years. She
        has a passion to initiate and start projects to meet needs that she sees
        around her. She had this idea of starting a nonprofit to provide
        clothing to the homeless and underserved communities years ago. After
        receiving her MBA degree in 2019, she has been formulating ideas and
        doing research to start this nonprofit. She has an affinity for clothes,
        of course, and it gives her great joy to see the happy faces of those
        who receive new clothes that are very much appreciated!
        <br />

        Helen earned a BBA degree in Accounting from Texas A&M University and an
        MBA degree from University of California Irvine, Paul Merage School of
