      Founder and CEO, Helen Low
      <br />
      <br />
      Helen Low has worked in the accounting/finance sector for 30+ years. She
      has a passion to initiate and start projects to meet needs that she sees
      around her. She had this idea of starting a nonprofit to provide clothing
      to the homeless and underserved communities years ago. She then received
      her MBA degree in 2019 from UC Irvine and since then has been formulating
      ideas and doing research to start this nonprofit. She has an affinity for
      clothes, of course, and it gives her great joy to see the happy faces of
      those who receive new clothes that they very much appreciate!
